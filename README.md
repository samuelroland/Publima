# Publima
### A publication management tool designed for collectives.

## Introduction
In brief, **Publima** is free software (used as a web application) **to manage publications in a collective**. The aim is to *collaborate efficiently*, be able to *plan* intelligently, have a *global overview*, increase *transparency and collaboration*, help to *apply the internal process and rules* and *involve members*, at each step.

Here by `publication`, we mean every public creations (texts or multimedia). By `collective`, we mean every group that communicates publicly and where several people manage the communication. Obviously, it includes social networks, blogs, newsletters, podcasts, ... but it concerns any kind of publishing plateforms with text and/or multimedia content. The plateform (at least the first versions) will not send automatically the publications, when publications are ready to be published, the publications on each choosen plateform must be sent manually.

The platform should help **to reduce complexity** with challenges around publications. A publication is usually not only a text, often some visuals, multimedia content or files are sent too. In addition, they are a bunch of things that make collaboration harder: publishing platforms constraints, translations, feedbacks and fixes management, validation processes, members' skills, ...

**Status**: This project is **currently at the starting point.** Nothing is implemented yet. Some points/ideas/feature priority will change over time and enhance depending on user feedback.

## Development Strategy
The aim of the strategy is to maximize the chances to make a useful app, validate the idea before to start coding, implement the most needed features not the others, ...
### Steps
- [ ] Read existing documents of discussions around collaboration.
- [ ] Interview 15 persons by written or oral.
- [ ] Write down the most important problems. Decide which features can resolve/help them.
- [ ] Search for existing solutions and compare them. Write down good ideas and common points.
- [ ] Define the MVP
- [ ] ....

#### Which parts are pain points in publication management ?

- To Be Defined with user feedbacks

#### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- To be defined

### Time allocated
**1 month**. Between 23.08.2021 and 19.09.2021. The goal is to develop fast and to not spend more than 1 month and a half on it.
Reflection work has already been done. A [logical data model (LDM)](docs/MLD.png) is already done. Here is the estimated program for the month:
1. 1 week of research and user interviews/talks
1. 2.5 weeks of development (with very frequent feedback loops)
1. 0.5 Week to test security, fix last bugs, deploy, and teach users how to use it (make a video or a document to explain).

## Personal goals
1. Validate a project idea with user interviews to really understand their problems and needs.
1. Understand deeply pain points to be able to offer the most useful features
1. Provide a tool that resolves or help these problems
1. Try to work with an extremely short feedback loop (1-2 days) with different future users
1. Learn technically about the TALL stack, deployment and web app updates
1. Learn to write unit and features tests for Laravel and Livewire
1. Try to produce software in a short period, by implementing the most useful features and what really matters
1. Experimenting with production and maintenance of a web app, used by about 20 users
