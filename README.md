# Publima
### A publication management tool designed for collectives.

In brief, **Publima** is free software and web application to manage publications in a collective. The aim is to *collaborate efficiently*, be able to *plan* intelligently, have a *global overview*, increase *transparency* and *involve members*, at each step.  
The platform should help **to reduce complexity** concerning big challenges. Just to name a few: publishing platforms constraints, translations, additional multimedia content, feedbacks and fixes management, validation processes, members' skills, ... with publications on diverse publishing websites: social networks, blogs, newsletters, podcasts, ...

**Status**: This project is currently _an idea._ Some points/ideas will change over time and enhance depending on user feedback.

### Time allocated
**1 month**. Between 23.08.2021 and 19.09.2021.  
Reflection work has already been done. A [logical data model (LDM)](docs/MLD.png) is already done. Here is the estimated program for the month:
1. 1 week of research and user interviews/talks
1. 2.5 weeks of development (with very frequent feedback loops)
1. 0.5 Week to test security, fix last bugs, deploy, and teach users how to use it (make a video or a document to explain).

## Personal goals
1. Validate a project idea with user interviews to really understand their problems and needs.
1. Understand deeply pain points to be able to offer the most useful features
1. Provide a tool that resolves or help these problems
1. Try to work with an extremely short feedback loop (1-2 days) with different future users
1. Learn technically about the TALL stack, deployment and web app updates
1. Learn to write unit and features tests for Laravel and Livewire
1. Try to produce software in a short period, by implementing the most useful features and what really matters
1. Experimenting with production and maintenance of a web app, used by about 20 users
