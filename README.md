The platform should help **breaking down complexity** concerning big challenges. Just to name a few: publishing platforms constraints, translations, additional multimedia content, feedbacks and fixes management, validation processes, ... with publications on diverse publishing websites: social networks, blogs, newsletters, podcasts, ...

**Status**: This project is currently _an idea._ Some points/ideas will change over time and enhance depending on user feedback.

1. Provide a tool that resolves or help these problems.
1. Learn technically about the TALL stack.
